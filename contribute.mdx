# How to Contribute

## 1. Updating Existing Laws

To update an existing law:

1. **Find the Law**: Locate the MDX file for the law you want to update in the appropriate volume folder.
2. **Edit the MDX File**:
   - Open the file in your code editor.
   - Make necessary changes to the content, ensuring you maintain the original structure.
3. **Commit Changes**:
   - Save the file.
   - Commit the changes with a descriptive message (e.g., "Update Act No. XX of YYYY").
4. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to the remote repository.
5. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the GitHub repository.
   - Create a new pull request with a clear title and description of your changes.

## 2. Verification and Status Updates

You can contribute by verifying the accuracy and completeness of laws on our platform. This involves two types of updates in our [laws index](/list):

### Status Column Updates

Review each law's current legal standing and update the **Status** column accordingly:

- **Active**: The law is currently in force and enforceable
- **Repealed**: The law has been officially revoked or superseded
- **Amended**: The law has been modified but remains active
- **Not Verified**: Default status indicating the law requires review

### Checked Column Updates

Verify content accuracy by comparing our website version with the original official sources, then update the **Checked** column:

- **Yes**: Content has been verified against official sources and is accurate
- **No**: Content requires verification or has known discrepancies
- **Partial**: Some sections verified, others need review

### Verification Process

1. **Source Comparison**: Compare our content with the official Bangladesh legal database
2. **Content Review**: Check for formatting, completeness, and accuracy
3. **Update Status**: Modify both Status and Checked columns as appropriate
4. **Document Changes**: Include detailed commit messages explaining your updates
