# Prerequisites

Before contributing, please ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of Markdown and MDX syntax
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub
- Access to a code editor (e.g., VSCode)
- Basic scraping knowledge (optional, for scraping new laws)

# How to Contribute

## 1. Adding New Laws

To add a new law, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Law**: Find the law you want to add from the official Bangladesh legal [database](http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/). Ensure it is not already included in the repository.
   - Check the existing laws in the relevant volume folder (e.g., `laws/volume-1/`).
   - If the law is not present, note down its title, number, date, and a brief summary.
2. **Create a New MDX File**:
   - Navigate to the appropriate volume folder (e.g., `laws/volume-1/`).
   - Create a new file named `act-{number}.mdx`, where `{number}` is the next available number in the sequence.
3. **Format the MDX File**:

   - Use the following template:

   ```mdx
   ---
   title: "ACT TITLE"
   description: "Brief description of the act"
   ---

   ## ACT NO. XX OF YYYY

   ## **Date:** DD Month, YYYY

   ## Summary

   A brief summary of the act.

   ## Sections

   ### 1. Section Title

   Description of the section.

   ### 2. Another Section Title

   ## Description of the section.

   _Source: [Bangladesh Legal Database](http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-details-{number}.html)_
   ```

4. **Add Content**: Fill in the title, description, date, summary, sections, and source link.
5. **Commit Changes**:
   - Add the new file to your local repository.
   - Commit the changes with a descriptive message (e.g., "Add Act No. XX of YYYY").
6. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to the remote repository.
7. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the GitHub repository.
   - Create a new pull request with a clear title and description of your changes.

## 2. Updating Existing Laws

To update an existing law:

1. **Find the Law**: Locate the MDX file for the law you want to update in the appropriate volume folder.
2. **Edit the MDX File**:
   - Open the file in your code editor.
   - Make necessary changes to the content, ensuring you maintain the original structure.
3. **Commit Changes**:
   - Save the file.
   - Commit the changes with a descriptive message (e.g., "Update Act No. XX of YYYY").
4. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to the remote repository.
5. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the GitHub repository.
   - Create a new pull request with a clear title and description of your changes.

## 3. Scraping New Laws

If you want to scrape new laws from the official Bangladesh legal database:

1. **Identify the Laws**: Determine which laws you want to scrape.
2. **Use a Scraping Tool**:
   - You can use tools like BeautifulSoup (Python) or Puppeteer (JavaScript) to scrape the data.
   - Ensure you follow the website's terms of service and robots.txt file.
3. **Format the Scraped Data**:
   - Convert the scraped data into the MDX format as described in the "Adding New Laws" section.
4. **Follow the Steps for Adding New Laws**:
   - Create a new MDX file, fill in the content, commit, push, and create a pull request as described above.
