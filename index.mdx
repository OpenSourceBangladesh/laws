# Why?

Official websites for Bangladeshi laws are often difficult to navigate, with outdated links and poor search functionality. This site aims to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing the laws of Bangladesh.

## How?

First of all, I scraped the official website of Bangladesh laws, which is [bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd](http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/). Then I used a script to convert the scraped data into .mdx that can be used by this site. The site is built using [Mintlify](https://Mintlify.com/) which provide better search functionality and user experience. I tried to deploy it MkDocs, but it doesnt have the AI search functionality. So I used Mintlify to build this site.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Index**: All Bangladeshi laws organized by volume, covering legislation from 1799 to 2025.
- **AI Search**: Quickly find relevant laws using AI-powered search functionality.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation and access to legal documents.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Optimized for viewing on mobile devices.
- **Open Source**: The project is open for contributions, allowing anyone to help improve the site.

## How to Use

1. **Browse by Volume**: Navigate through the volumes to find specific laws.
2. **Search Functionality**: Use the AI search bar to find laws by keywords, titles, or topics.
3. **View Law Details**: Click on a law to view its full text, including sections and amendments.
