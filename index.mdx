# Why?

Official websites for Bangladeshi laws are often difficult to navigate, with outdated links and poor search functionality. This site aims to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing the laws of Bangladesh.

## How?

First of all, I scraped the official website of Bangladesh laws, which is [bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd](http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/). Then, processed the data to create a structured index of all Bangladeshi laws.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Index**: All Bangladeshi laws organized by volume, covering legislation from 1799 to till date.
- **AI Search**: Quickly find relevant laws using AI-powered search functionality.[Currently disbaled as it is a paid feature offered by Mintlify]
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation and access to legal documents.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Optimized for viewing on mobile devices.
- **Open Source**: The project is open for contributions, allowing anyone to help improve the site.

## How to Use?

1. **Browse by Volume**: Navigate through the volumes to find specific laws.
2. **Browse by Year**: Use the chronological list to find laws enacted in specific years.[Currently It is not implemented, but will be added soon]
3. **Search Functionality**: Use the AI search bar to find laws by keywords, titles, or topics.
4. **View Law Details**: Click on a law to view its full text, including sections and amendments.
